## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JQuery] (https://releases.jquery.com/) - JQuery CDN

### What I learned

I learned something new about building from scratch and I am the ouput. But I am still want more add skill and knowledge building site, because I almost 6 years build a site using WordPress that just drag and drop only. I want coding like this from scratch, I already manage like this before way back 2016 like building themes from scratch in WordPress.

### Continued development

I Will continue learning CSS because what I learn for this project is to know about the grid, I though using float or even disply inline is the better way to create row and column, when I build this project I found is the best solution is to use Grid flex.
